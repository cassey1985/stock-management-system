# Multi-Payment Feature - Implementation Complete

## ðŸŽ‰ **New Feature: Multi-Product Payment**

The Customer Debts section now supports paying multiple products/debts in a single transaction!

### âœ¨ **How It Works**

1. **Multi-Payment Button**: New green "ðŸ’° Multi-Payment" button in Customer Debts header
2. **Debt Selection**: Checkboxes appear for all unpaid debts
3. **Payment Allocation**: Similar to multi-product sales - proportional distribution
4. **Single Transaction**: One payment covers multiple products

### ðŸŽ® **Usage Instructions**

#### **Step 1: Start Multi-Payment**
- Go to **Customer Debts** section
- Click the **ðŸ’° Multi-Payment** button

#### **Step 2: Select Debts**
- Modal opens showing all unpaid debts
- Check the debts you want to pay
- **Important**: All selected debts must be from the same customer

#### **Step 3: Enter Payment Details**
- **Payment Date**: When payment was received
- **Payment Method**: Cash, Card, Bank Transfer, Check, Other
- **Total Amount Paid**: The actual amount customer paid
- **Payment Allocation**: Currently supports Proportional (automatic distribution)
- **Reference**: Optional (receipt #, check #, etc.)
- **Notes**: Optional additional information

#### **Step 4: Review & Submit**
- Payment Summary shows:
  - Number of selected debts
  - Total debt amount
  - Payment amount
- Click **Record Multi-Payment** to process

### ðŸ’¡ **Example Scenario**

**Customer**: John Doe owes money for 3 different instant lottery products:
- Product A: â‚±500 remaining
- Product B: â‚±300 remaining  
- Product C: â‚±200 remaining
- **Total Debt**: â‚±1,000

**Payment**: John pays â‚±600

**Proportional Allocation**:
- Product A gets: â‚±600 Ã— (â‚±500/â‚±1,000) = â‚±300
- Product B gets: â‚±600 Ã— (â‚±300/â‚±1,000) = â‚±180
- Product C gets: â‚±600 Ã— (â‚±200/â‚±1,000) = â‚±120

**Results**:
- Product A: â‚±200 remaining (â‚±500 - â‚±300)
- Product B: â‚±120 remaining (â‚±300 - â‚±180)
- Product C: â‚±80 remaining (â‚±200 - â‚±120)
