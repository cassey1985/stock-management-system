# Multi-Product Sales Feature - Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Overview
The multi-product sales feature allows customers to purchase multiple different products in a single transaction, with flexible payment allocation options. This solves the problem of tracking which products receive payment when customers make partial payments on multiple items.

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Sale Mode Selection**
- **Single Product Sale**: Traditional one-product-per-transaction mode (existing functionality)
- **Multi-Product Sale**: New mode for bundling multiple products with payment allocation

### 2. **Payment Allocation Methods**

#### A. Proportional Allocation (Automatic)
- System automatically distributes payment based on product value proportions
- **Example**: Product A (₱1,000), Product B (₱2,000), Payment (₱1,500)
  - Product A gets: ₱1,500 × (₱1,000/₱3,000) = ₱500
  - Product B gets: ₱1,500 × (₱2,000/₱3,000) = ₱1,000

#### B. Manual Allocation
- User manually specifies exact payment amounts per product
- Full control over which products get priority payment
- Validation prevents over-allocation

### 3. **Enhanced Data Tracking**

#### New Database Fields
- `saleGroupId`: Groups related products from same multi-product sale
- `isMultiProductSale`: Boolean flag to identify multi-product transactions  
- `allocatedPayment`: Specific payment amount allocated to each product

#### Backward Compatibility
- Existing single-product sales remain fully functional
- All existing data preserved and accessible
- New fields are optional and don't affect legacy records

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components

- ✅ Historical reports and calculations unaffected
- ✅ No database migration required

### New Data Validation
- ✅ Prevents over-allocation of payments
- ✅ Validates product inventory before sale
- ✅ Ensures payment allocation totals don't exceed amount paid
- ✅ Maintains FIFO cost calculation accuracy

## 📈 Reporting Integration

### Financial Reports
- Multi-product sales integrate seamlessly with existing financial ledger
- Each product sale creates separate transaction records
- Profit calculations remain accurate per product
- Payment tracking works with existing debt management

### Customer Reports

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the Implementation**:
   - Start backend server: `cd server && npm start`
   - Start frontend: `npm run dev`
   - Navigate to Stock Out section
   - Try creating multi-product sales

2. **Verify Data Accuracy**:

   - Deploy new code
   - Monitor for any issues

## 💡 Usage Tips

### Best Practices
- Use proportional allocation for even payment distribution
- Use manual allocation when customer specifies product priorities
- Always review payment summary before submitting
- Check customer debt reports to verify payment allocation

### Common Scenarios
- **Partial Payment**: Customer pays 50% down on multiple products
- **Priority Payment**: Customer wants to fully pay specific products first
- **Mixed Payment**: Some products paid in full, others partially

## 🛟 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Payment over-allocation**: Check that individual allocations don't exceed product totals
- **Missing products**: Ensure all products are added to product master first
- **FIFO errors**: Verify sufficient inventory exists for all products

### Data Recovery  
- Original StockOut component backed up as `StockOut_Backup.tsx`
- All database operations are atomic and reversible
- Individual sale records can be edited/deleted as needed
